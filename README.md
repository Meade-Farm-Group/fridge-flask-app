# Fridge Viewer App

## Project Inception 

This project was concepted during my time at [Meade Potato Company](https://www.meadefarm.ie/), a fresh
goods processor based in Ireland. In order for product to be moved around and processed, it needs to be
first located. To find this product, it needs to be searched through a table. Once it is found, the
product needs to have its new location entered, which an be very time consuming and may be subject to 
human error.
To resolve this, an app was designed to visualize which locations have pallets in them, and to also allow
the user to view the pallet details clearly.

## UX

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create an app that will make it easier to get the locations and details of
pallets.
